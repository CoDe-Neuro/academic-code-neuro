My undergraduate degree was in medicine at Imperial College London. Following this I worked as a general doctor and psychiatrist, before starting my PhD in 2020. Since 2024 I am a Clinical Lecturer at the IoPPN, studying the relationship between socio-economic status, brain biology and early life outcomes.
