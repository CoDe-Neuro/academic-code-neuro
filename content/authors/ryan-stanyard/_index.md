interests: 
- Originally trained in Neuroscience and Psychology (BSc, Keele), I then specialised in Neuroimaging (MSc, MRes, Kingâ€™s College London). My PhD utilises graph theory, neuroimaging methods and whole-brain computational modelling to examine how neurodevelopmental disease modulates the coupling of brain structure and function across the lifespan.
