abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The structural correspondence of neurodevelopmental impairments
  related to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) that persists later in life remains
  elusive. Moreover, early postnatal stimulation strategies have been proposed to
  mitigate these effects. Long-term brain connectivity abnormalities in an IUGR rabbit
  model and the effects of early postnatal environmental enrichment (EE) were explored.
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: IUGR was surgically induced in one horn, whereas the contralateral
  one produced the controls. Postnatally, a subgroup of IUGR animals was housed in
  an enriched environment. Functional assessment was performed at the neonatal and
  long-term periods. At the long-term period, structural brain connectivity was evaluated
  by means of diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging and by histological
  assessment focused on the hippocampus. RESULTS: IUGR animals displayed poorer functional
  results and presented altered whole-brain networks and decreased median fractional
  anisotropy in the hippocampus. Reduced density of dendritic spines and perineuronal
  nets from hippocampal neurons were also observed. Of note, IUGR animals exposed
  to enriched environment presented an improvement in terms of both function and structure.
  CONCLUSIONS: IUGR is associated with altered brain connectivity at the global and
  cellular level. A strategy based on early EE has the potential to restore the neurodevelopmental
  consequences of IUGR.'
