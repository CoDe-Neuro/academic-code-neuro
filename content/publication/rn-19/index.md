abstract: Structural (also known as anatomical) and diffusion MRI provide complimentary
  anatomical and microstructural characterization of early brain maturation. However,
  the existing models of the developing brain in time include only either structural
  or diffusion MRI channels. Furthermore, there is a lack of tools for combined analysis
  of structural and diffusion MRI in the same reference space. In this work, we propose
  a methodology to generate a multi-channel (MC) continuous spatio-temporal parametrized
  atlas of the brain development that combines multiple MRI-derived parameters in
  the same anatomical space during 37-44 weeks of postmenstrual age range. We co-align
  structural and diffusion MRI of 170 normal term subjects from the developing Human
  Connectomme Project using MC registration driven by both T2-weighted and orientation
  distribution functions channels and fit the Gompertz model to the signals and spatial
  transformations in time. The resulting atlas consists of 14 spatio-temporal microstructural
  indices and two parcellation maps delineating white matter tracts and neonatal transient
  structures. In order to demonstrate applicability of the atlas for quantitative
  region-specific studies, a comparison analysis of 140 term and 40 preterm subjects
  scanned at the term-equivalent age is performed using different MRI-derived microstructural
  indices in the atlas reference space for multiple white matter regions, including
  the transient compartments. The atlas and software will be available after publication
  of the article.
