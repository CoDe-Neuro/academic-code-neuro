abstract: "Very preterm (VPT; < 33 weeks' gestation) toddlers screening positively
  for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) may display heterogenous neurodevelopmental
  trajectories. Here we studied neonatal brain volumes and childhood ASC traits evaluated
  with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) in VPT-born toddlers (N = 371; median
  age 20.17 months) sub-divided into three groups based on their Modified-Checklist
  for Autism in Toddlers scores. These were: those screening positively failing at
  least 2 critical items (critical-positive); failing any 3 items, but less than 2
  critical items (non-critical-positive); and screening negatively. Critical-positive
  scorers had smaller neonatal cerebellar volumes compared to non-critical-positive
  and negative scorers. However, both positive screening groups exhibited higher childhood
  ASC traits compared to the negative screening group, suggesting distinct aetiological
  trajectories associated with ASC outcomes."
