abstract: Pain is multidimensional, including sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational,
  and cognitive-evaluative components. Although the concept of pain is learned through
  life, it is not known when and how the brain networks that are required to encode
  these different dimensions of pain develop. Using the 2 largest available databases
  of brain magnetic resonance images-the developing Human Connectome Project and the
  Human Connectome Project-we have mapped the development of the pain connectome-the
  neural network required for pain perception-in infants from 26 to 42 weeks of postmenstrual
  age (PMA, n = 372), compared with adults (n = 98). Partial correlation analysis
  of resting BOLD signal between pairwise combinations of 12 pain-related brain regions
  showed that overall functional connectivity is significantly weaker before 32 weeks
  PMA compared with adults. However, over the following weeks, significantly different
  developmental trajectories emerge across pain connectome subnetworks. The first
  subnetwork to reach adult levels in strength and proportion of connections is the
  sensory-discriminative subnetwork (34-36 weeks PMA), followed by the affective-motivational
  subnetwork (36-38 weeks PMA), while the cognitive-evaluative subnetwork has still
  not reached adult levels at term. This study reveals a previously unknown pattern
  of early development of the infrastructure necessary to encode different components
  of pain experience. Newborn neural pathways required for mature pain processing
  in the brain are incomplete in newborns compared with adults, particularly regarding
  the emotional and evaluative aspects of pain. The rapid age-related changes suggest
  that pain processing, and consequently pain experience, changes rapidly over this
  developmental period and unlikely to be the same as in adults, even at term.
