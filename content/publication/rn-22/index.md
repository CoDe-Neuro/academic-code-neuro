abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Exposure to maternal stress in utero is associated with a range
  of adverse outcomes. We previously observed an association between maternal stress
  and white matter microstructure in a sample of infants born prematurely. In this
  study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between maternal trait anxiety,
  stressful life events and brain volumes. METHODS: 221 infants (114 males, 107 females)
  born prematurely (median gestational age = 30.43 weeks [range 23.57-32.86]) underwent
  magnetic resonance imaging around term-equivalent age (mean = 42.20 weeks, SD =
  1.60). Brain volumes were extracted for the following regions of interest: frontal
  lobe, temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and normalized to total brain
  volume. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to investigate the relationship
  between maternal anxiety/stress and brain volumes, controlling for gestational age
  at birth, postmenstrual age at scan, socioeconomic status, sex, days on total parenteral
  nutrition. Additional exploratory Tensor Based Morphometry analyses were performed
  to obtain voxel-wise brain volume changes from Jacobian determinant maps. RESULTS
  AND CONCLUSION: In this large prospective study, we did not find evidence of a relationship
  between maternal prenatal stress or trait anxiety and brain volumes. This was the
  case for both the main analysis using a region-of-interest approach, and for the
  exploratory analysis using Jacobian determinant maps. We discuss these results in
  the context of conflicting evidence from previous studies and highlight the need
  for further research on premature infants, particularly including term-born controls.'
