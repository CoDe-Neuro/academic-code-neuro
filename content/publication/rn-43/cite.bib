 abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a recent proliferation in neuroimaging research focusing on brain development in the prenatal, neonatal and very early childhood brain. Early brain injury and preterm birth are associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating the importance of this early period for later outcome. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY: Although using a wide range of different methodologies and investigating diverse samples, the common aim of many of these studies has been to both track normative development and investigate deviations in this development to predict behavioural, cognitive and neurological function in childhood. Here we review structural and functional neuroimaging studies investigating the developing brain. We focus on practical and technical complexities of studying this early age range and discuss how neuroimaging techniques have been successfully applied to investigate later neurodevelopmental outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroimaging markers of later outcome still have surprisingly low predictive power and their specificity to individual neurodevelopmental disorders is still under question. However, the field is still young, and substantial challenges to both acquiring and modeling neonatal data are being met.},
