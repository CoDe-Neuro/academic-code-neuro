abstract: 'BACKGROUND: There has been a recent proliferation in neuroimaging research
  focusing on brain development in the prenatal, neonatal and very early childhood
  brain. Early brain injury and preterm birth are associated with increased risk of
  neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating the importance of this early period for
  later outcome. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY: Although using a wide range of different methodologies
  and investigating diverse samples, the common aim of many of these studies has been
  to both track normative development and investigate deviations in this development
  to predict behavioural, cognitive and neurological function in childhood. Here we
  review structural and functional neuroimaging studies investigating the developing
  brain. We focus on practical and technical complexities of studying this early age
  range and discuss how neuroimaging techniques have been successfully applied to
  investigate later neurodevelopmental outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroimaging markers
  of later outcome still have surprisingly low predictive power and their specificity
  to individual neurodevelopmental disorders is still under question. However, the
  field is still young, and substantial challenges to both acquiring and modeling
  neonatal data are being met.'
