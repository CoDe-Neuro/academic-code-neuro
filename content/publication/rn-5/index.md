abstract: Preterm birth results in premature exposure of the brain to the extrauterine
  environment during a critical period of neurodevelopment. Consequently, infants
  born preterm are at a heightened risk of adverse behavioural outcomes in later life.
  We characterise longitudinal development of neonatal regional brain volume and functional
  connectivity in the first weeks following preterm birth, sociodemographic factors,
  and their respective relationships to psychomotor outcomes and psychopathology in
  toddlerhood. We study 121 infants born preterm who underwent magnetic resonance
  imaging shortly after birth, at term-equivalent age, or both. Longitudinal regional
  brain volume and functional connectivity were modelled as a function of psychopathology
  and psychomotor outcomes at 18 months. Better psychomotor functioning in toddlerhood
  was associated with greater relative right cerebellar volume and a more rapid decrease
  over time of sensorimotor degree centrality in the neonatal period. In contrast,
  increased 18-month psychopathology was associated with a more rapid decrease in
  relative regional subcortical volume. Furthermore, while socio-economic deprivation
  was related to both psychopathology and psychomotor outcomes, cognitively stimulating
  parenting predicted psychopathology only. Our study highlights the importance of
  longitudinal imaging to better predict toddler outcomes following preterm birth,
  as well as disparate environmental influences on separable facets of behavioural
  development in this population.
