abstract: Abstract  Purpose Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) studies report
  altered white matter (WM) development in preterm infants. Neurite orientation dispersion
  and density imaging (NODDI) metrics provide more realistic estimations of neurite
  architecture in vivo compared with standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics.
  This study investigated microstructural maturation of WM in preterm neonates scanned
  between 25 and 45 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) with normal neurodevelopmental outcomes
  at 2 years using DTI and NODDI metrics.   Methods  Thirty-one neonates ( n = 17
  male) with median (range) gestational age (GA) 32 +1 weeks (24 +2 –36 +4 ) underwent
  3 T brain MRI at median (range) post menstrual age (PMA) 35 +2 weeks (25 +3 –43
  +1 ). WM tracts (cingulum, fornix, corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal
  fasciculus (ILF), optic radiations) were delineated using constrained spherical
  deconvolution and probabilistic tractography in MRtrix3. DTI and NODDI metrics were
  extracted for the whole tract and cross-sections along each tract to assess regional
  development.    Results PMA at scan positively correlated with fractional anisotropy
  (FA) in the CST, fornix and optic radiations and neurite density index (NDI) in
  the cingulum, CST and fornix and negatively correlated with mean diffusivity (MD)
  in all tracts. A multilinear regression model demonstrated PMA at scan influenced
  all diffusion measures, GA and GAxPMA at scan influenced FA, MD and NDI and gender
  affected NDI. Cross-sectional analyses revealed asynchronous WM maturation within
  and between WM tracts.).   Conclusion We describe normal WM maturation in preterm
  neonates with normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. NODDI can enhance our understanding
  of WM maturation compared with standard DTI metrics alone.
