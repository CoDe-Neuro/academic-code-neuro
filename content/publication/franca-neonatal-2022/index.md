abstract: 'Abstract Brain functional dynamics have been linked to emotion and cognition
  in mature individuals, where alterations are associated with mental ill-health and
  neurodevelopmental conditions (such as autism spectrum disorder). Although reliable
  resting-state networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is
  known about the early development of dynamic brain functional connectivity and whether
  it is linked to later neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood. In this study we
  characterised dynamic functional connectivity in the first few weeks of postnatal
  life and evaluated whether early dynamic functional connectivity: i) changes with
  age in the neonatal period ii) is altered by preterm birth and iii) is associated
  with neurodevelopmental and behavioural outcomes at 18 months.  We used the Kuramoto
  Order Parameter as a metric of global brain synchrony and defined transient brain
  states (modules) using Leading Eigenvector Analysis (LEiDA) in a cohort of term-born
  ( n =324) and preterm-born babies ( n =66) scanned at term equivalent age from the
  developing Human Connectome Project. We assessed whether neonatal brain state features
  (mean synchrony, metastability, entropy, fractional occupancy, dwelling times) and
  state transition probabilities were associated with postmenstrual age at scan, postnatal
  days at scan and preterm-birth; and correlate with neurodevelopmental outcomes at
  18 months measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, and
  atypical social, sensory and repetitive behaviours measured by the Quantitative
  Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT).  On a global scale, preterm-born infants
  had lower mean synchronisation and metastability, with reduced mean synchronisation
  associated with higher Q-CHAT scores at 18 months of age. On a modular scale, we
  identified six transient states of neonatal dynamic functional connectivity: three
  whole-brain synchronisation states and three regional synchrony states occupying
  occipital, sensory-motor, and frontal regions. Mean synchrony, metastability, fractional
  occupancy and dwelling times of these brain states were correlated with postmenstrual
  age and postnatal days at scan. Preterm-born infants had increased fractional occupancy
  of frontal and occipital states. Higher neonatal sensory-motor synchronisation was
  associated with lower motor and language outcome scores at 18 months. Lower frequency
  of occurrence of whole-brain synchronisation states and higher frequency of occurrence
  of the sensory-motor state were associated with higher Q-CHAT scores at 18 months.
  Thus, we have shown for the first time that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity
  is already established by the time of birth in the human brain. This landscape is
  altered by preterm birth and its profile is linked to neurodevelopmental outcomes
  in toddlerhood.'
