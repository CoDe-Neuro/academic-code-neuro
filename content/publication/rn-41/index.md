abstract: Measures obtained from diffusion-weighted imaging provide objective indices
  of white matter development and injury in the developing preterm brain. To date,
  diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used widely, highlighting differences in
  fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between preterm infants at
  term and healthy term controls; altered white matter development associated with
  a number of perinatal risk factors; and correlations between FA values in the white
  matter in the neonatal period and subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome. Recent
  developments, including neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)
  and fixel-based analysis (FBA), enable white matter microstructure to be assessed
  in detail. Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) enables multiple fibre populations
  in an imaging voxel to be resolved and allows delineation of fibres that traverse
  regions of fibre-crossings, such as the arcuate fasciculus and cerebellar-cortical
  pathways. This review summarises DTI findings in the preterm brain and discusses
  initial findings in this population using CSD, NODDI, and FBA.
