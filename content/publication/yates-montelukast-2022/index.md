abstract: Abstract Encephalopathy of prematurity (EoP) affects approximately 30% of
  infants born textless 32 weeks gestation and is highly associated with inflammation
  in the foetus. Here we evaluated the efficacy of montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene
  receptor antagonist widely used to treat asthma in children, to ameliorate peripheral
  and central inflammation, and subsequent grey matter neuropathology and behaviour
  deficits in a mouse model of EoP. Male CD-1 mice were treated with intraperitoneal
  (i.p.) saline or interleukin-1beta (IL-1β, 40 μg/kg, 5 μL/g body weight) from postnatal
  day (P)1–5 ± concomitant montelukast (1–30 mg/kg). Saline or montelukast treatment
  was continued for a further 5 days post-injury. Assessment of systemic and central
  inflammation and short-term neuropathology was performed from 4 h following treatment
  through to P10. Behavioural testing, MRI and neuropathological assessments were
  made on a second cohort of animals from P36 to 54. Montelukast was found to attenuate
  both peripheral and central inflammation, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory
  molecules (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF) in the brain. Inflammation induced a reduction in parvalbumin-positive
  interneuron density in the cortex, which was normalised with high-dose montelukast.
  The lowest effective dose, 3 mg/kg, was able to improve anxiety and spatial learning
  deficits in this model of inflammatory injury, and alterations in cortical mean
  diffusivity were not present in animals that received this dose of montelukast.
  Repurposed montelukast administered early after preterm birth may, therefore, improve
  grey matter development and outcome in EoP.
