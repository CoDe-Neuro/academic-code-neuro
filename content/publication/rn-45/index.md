abstract: In the mature human brain, the arcuate fasciculus mediates verbal working
  memory, word learning, and sublexical speech repetition. However, its contribution
  to early language acquisition remains unclear. In this work, we aimed to evaluate
  the role of the direct segments of the arcuate fasciculi in the early acquisition
  of linguistic function. We imaged a cohort of 43 preterm born infants (median age
  at birth of 30 gestational weeks; median age at scan of 42 postmenstrual weeks)
  using high b value high-angular resolution diffusion-weighted neuroimaging and assessed
  their linguistic performance at 2 years of age. Using constrained spherical deconvolution
  tractography, we virtually dissected the arcuate fasciculi and measured fractional
  anisotropy (FA) as a metric of white matter development. We found that term equivalent
  FA of the left and right arcuate fasciculi was significantly associated with individual
  differences in linguistic and cognitive abilities in early childhood, independent
  of the degree of prematurity. These findings suggest that differences in arcuate
  fasciculi microstructure at the time of normal birth have a significant impact on
  language development and modulate the first stages of language learning. Hum Brain
