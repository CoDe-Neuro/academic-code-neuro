abstract: 'In electroencephalographic (EEG) data, power-frequency slope exponents
  (1/f(_beta)) can provide non-invasive markers of in vivo neural activity excitation-inhibition
  (E:I) balance. E:I balance may be altered in neurodevelopmental conditions; hence,
  understanding how 1/f(beta) evolves across infancy/childhood has implications for
  developing early assessments/interventions. This systematic review (PROSPERO-ID:
  CRD42023363294) explored the early maturation (0-26â€¯yrs) of resting-state EEG 1/f
  measures (aperiodic [AE], power law [PLE] and Hurst [HE] exponents), including studies
  containing >/=1 1/f measures and >/=10 typically developing participants. Five databases
  (including Embase and Scopus) were searched during March 2023. Forty-two studies
  were identified (N(participants)=3478). Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality
  Assessment with Diverse Studies tool. Narrative synthesis of HE data suggests non-stationary
  EEG activity occurs throughout development. Age-related trends were complex, with
  rapid decreases in AEs during infancy and heterogenous changes thereafter. Regionally,
  AE maxima shifted developmentally, potentially reflecting spatial trends in maturing
  brain connectivity. This work highlights the importance of further characterising
  the development of 1/f measures to better understand how E:I balance shapes brain
  and cognitive development.'
