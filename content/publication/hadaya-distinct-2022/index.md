abstract: 'Abstract  Very preterm (VPT; textless 33 weeks’ gestation) toddlers screening
  positively for autism spectrum conditions (ASC) may display heterogenous neurodevelopmental
  trajectories. Here we studied neonatal brain volumes and childhood ASC traits evaluated
  with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) in VPT-born toddlers (N = 371; median
  age 20.17 months) sub-divided into three groups based on their Modified-Checklist
  for Autism in Toddlers scores. These were: those screening positively failing at
  least 2 critical items ( critical-positive ); failing any 3 items, but less than
  2 critical items ( non-critical-positive ); and screening negatively. Critical-positive
  scorers had smaller neonatal cerebellar volumes compared to non-critical-positive
  and negative scorers. However, both positive screening groups exhibited higher childhood
  ASC traits compared to the negative screening group, suggesting distinct aetiological
  trajectories associated with ASC outcomes.'
