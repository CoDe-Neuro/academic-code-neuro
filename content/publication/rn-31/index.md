abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Advanced paternal age is associated with poor offspring developmental
  outcome. Though an increase in paternal age-related germline mutations may affect
  offspring white matter development, outcome differences could also be due to psychosocial
  factors. Here we investigate possible cerebral changes prior to strong environmental
  influences using brain MRI in a cohort of healthy term-born neonates. METHODS: We
  used structural and diffusion MRI images acquired soon after birth from a cohort
  (n = 275) of healthy term-born neonates. Images were analysed using a customised
  tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) processing pipeline. Neurodevelopmental assessment
  using the Bayley-III scales was offered to all participants at age 18 months. For
  statistical analysis neonates were compared in two groups, representing the upper
  quartile (paternal age >/=38 years) and lower three quartiles. The same method was
  used to assess associations with maternal age. RESULTS: In infants with older fathers
  (>/=38 years), fractional anisotropy, a marker of white matter organisation, was
  significantly reduced in three early maturing anatomical locations (the corticospinal
  tract, the corpus callosum, and the optic radiation). Fractional anisotropy in these
  locations correlated positively with Bayley-III cognitive composite score at 18
  months in the advanced paternal age group. A small but significant reduction in
  total brain volume was also observed in in the infants of older fathers. No significant
  associations were found between advanced maternal age and neonatal imaging. CONCLUSIONS:
  The epidemiological association between advanced paternal age and offspring outcome
  is extremely robust. We have for the first time demonstrated a neuroimaging phenotype
  of advanced paternal age before sustained parental interaction that correlates with
  later outcome.'
