abstract: 'Altered reactivity and responses to auditory input are core to the diagnosis
  of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Preclinical models implicate Upsilon-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA) in this process. However, the link between GABA and auditory processing
  in humans (with or without ASD) is largely correlational. As part of a study of
  potential biosignatures of GABA function in ASD to inform future clinical trials,
  we evaluated the role of GABA in auditory repetition suppression in 66 adults (n
  = 28 with ASD). Neurophysiological responses (temporal and frequency domains) to
  repetitive standard tones and novel deviants presented in an oddball paradigm were
  compared after double-blind, randomized administration of placebo, 15 or 30 mg of
  arbaclofen (STX209), a GABA type B (GABA(B)) receptor agonist. We first established
  that temporal mismatch negativity was comparable between participants with ASD and
  those with typical development (TD). Next, we showed that temporal and spectral
  responses to repetitive standards were suppressed relative to responses to deviants
  in the two groups, but suppression was significantly weaker in individuals with
  ASD at baseline. Arbaclofen reversed weaker suppression of spectral responses in
  ASD but disrupted suppression in TD. A post hoc analysis showed that arbaclofen-elicited
  shift in suppression was correlated with autistic symptomatology measured using
  the Autism Quotient across the entire group, though not in the smaller sample of
  the ASD and TD group when examined separately. Thus, our results confirm: GABAergic
  dysfunction contributes to the neurophysiology of auditory sensory processing alterations
  in ASD, and can be modulated by targeting GABA(B) activity. These GABA-dependent
  sensory differences may be upstream of more complex autistic phenotypes.'
