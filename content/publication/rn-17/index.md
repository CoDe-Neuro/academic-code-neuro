abstract: Children with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental
  impairments. The neonatal antecedents of impaired behavioural development are unknown.
  43 infants with CHD underwent presurgical brain diffusion-weighted MRI [postmenstrual
  age at scan median (IQR) = 39.29 (38.71-39.71) weeks] and a follow-up assessment
  at median age of 22.1 (IQR 22.0-22.7) months in which parents reported internalizing
  and externalizing problem scores on the Child Behaviour Checklist. We constructed
  structural brain networks from diffusion-weighted MRI and calculated edge-wise structural
  connectivity as well as global and local brain network features. We also calculated
  presurgical cerebral oxygen delivery, and extracted perioperative variables, socioeconomic
  status at birth and a measure of cognitively stimulating parenting. Lower degree
  in the right inferior frontal gyrus (partial rho = -0.687, p < 0.001) and reduced
  connectivity in a frontal-limbic sub-network including the right inferior frontal
  gyrus were associated with higher externalizing problem scores. Externalizing problem
  scores were unrelated to neonatal clinical course or home environment. However,
  higher internalizing problem scores were associated with earlier surgery in the
  neonatal period (partial rho = -0.538, p = 0.014). Our results highlight the importance
  of frontal-limbic networks to the development of externalizing behaviours and provide
  new insights into early antecedents of behavioural impairments in CHD.
