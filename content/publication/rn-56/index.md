abstract: Obtaining individual biomarkers for the prediction of altered neurological
  outcome is a challenge of modern medicine and neuroscience. Connectomics based on
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stands as a good candidate to exhaustively extract
  information from MRI by integrating the information obtained in a few network features
  that can be used as individual biomarkers of neurological outcome. However, this
  approach typically requires the use of diffusion and/or functional MRI to extract
  individual brain networks, which require high acquisition times and present an extreme
  sensitivity to motion artifacts, critical problems when scanning fetuses and infants.
  Extraction of individual networks based on morphological similarity from gray matter
  is a new approach that benefits from the power of graph theory analysis to describe
  gray matter morphology as a large-scale morphological network from a typical clinical
  anatomic acquisition such as T1-weighted MRI. In the present paper we propose a
  methodology to normalize these large-scale morphological networks to a brain network
  with standardized size based on a parcellation scheme. The proposed methodology
  was applied to reconstruct individual brain networks of 63 one-year-old infants,
  41 infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and 22 controls, showing
  altered network features in the IUGR group, and their association with neurodevelopmental
  outcome at two years of age by means of ordinal regression analysis of the network
  features obtained with Bayley Scale for Infant and Toddler Development, third edition.
  Although it must be more widely assessed, this methodology stands as a good candidate
  for the development of biomarkers for altered neurodevelopment in the pediatric
  population.
