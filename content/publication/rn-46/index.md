abstract: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is becoming an increasingly important tool
  for studying brain development. DWI analyses relying on manually-drawn regions of
  interest and tractography using manually-placed waypoints are considered to provide
  the most accurate characterisation of the underlying brain structure. However, these
  methods are labour-intensive and become impractical for studies with large cohorts
  and numerous white matter (WM) tracts. Tract-specific analysis (TSA) is an alternative
  WM analysis method applicable to large-scale studies that offers potential benefits.
  TSA produces a skeleton representation of WM tracts and projects the group's diffusion
  data onto the skeleton for statistical analysis. In this work we evaluate the performance
  of TSA in analysing preterm infant data against results obtained from native space
  tractography and tract-based spatial statistics. We evaluate TSA's registration
  accuracy of WM tracts and assess the agreement between native space data and template
  space data projected onto WM skeletons, in 12 tracts across 48 preterm neonates.
  We show that TSA registration provides better WM tract alignment than a previous
  protocol optimised for neonatal spatial normalisation, and that TSA projects FA
  values that match well with values derived from native space tractography. We apply
  TSA for the first time to a preterm neonatal population to study the effects of
  age at scan on WM tracts around term equivalent age. We demonstrate the effects
  of age at scan on DTI metrics in commissural, projection and association fibres.
  We demonstrate the potential of TSA for WM analysis and its suitability for infant
  studies involving multiple tracts.
