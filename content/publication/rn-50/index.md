abstract: Disrupted cerebellar development and injury is associated with impairments
  in both motor and non-motor domains. Methods to non-invasively characterize cerebellar
  afferent and efferent connections during early development are lacking. The aim
  of this study was to assess the feasibility of delineating cortico-ponto-cerebellar
  (CPC) and cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) white matter tracts during brain development
  using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). HARDI data were obtained
  in 24 infants born between 24(+6) and 39 weeks gestational age (median 33(+4) weeks)
  and scanned between 29(+1) and 44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) (median 37(+1) weeks).
  Probabilistic tractography of CPC and CTC fibers was performed using constrained
  spherical deconvolution. Connections between cerebellum and contralateral cerebral
  hemisphere were identified in all infants studied. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values
  of CTC and CPC pathways increased with increasing PMA at scan (p < 0.001). The supratentorial
  regions connecting to contralateral cerebellum in most subjects, irrespective of
  PMA at scan, included the precentral cortex, superior frontal cortex, supplementary
  motor area, insula, postcentral cortex, precuneus, and paracentral lobule. This
  study demonstrates the feasibility of assessing CTC and CPC white matter connectivity
  in vivo during the early stages of development. The ability to assess cerebellar
  connectivity during this critical developmental period may help improve our understanding
  of the role of the cerebellum in a wide range of neuromotor and neurocognitive disorders.
