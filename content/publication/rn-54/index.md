abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) affects 5-10% of all
  newborns and is associated with increased risk of memory, attention and anxiety
  problems in late childhood and adolescence. The neurostructural correlates of long-term
  abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR are unknown. Thus, the aim of this
  study was to provide a comprehensive description of the long-term functional and
  neurostructural correlates of abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR in
  a near-term rabbit model (delivered at 30 days of gestation) and evaluate the development
  of quantitative imaging biomarkers of abnormal neurodevelopment based on diffusion
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and connectivity. METHODOLOGY: At +70
  postnatal days, 10 cases and 11 controls were functionally evaluated with the Open
  Field Behavioral Test which evaluates anxiety and attention and the Object Recognition
  Task that evaluates short-term memory and attention. Subsequently, brains were collected,
  fixed and a high resolution MRI was performed. Differences in diffusion parameters
  were analyzed by means of voxel-based and connectivity analysis measuring the number
  of fibers reconstructed within anxiety, attention and short-term memory networks
  over the total fibers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The results of the neurobehavioral and
  cognitive assessment showed a significant higher degree of anxiety, attention and
  memory problems in cases compared to controls in most of the variables explored.
  Voxel-based analysis (VBA) revealed significant differences between groups in multiple
  brain regions mainly in grey matter structures, whereas connectivity analysis demonstrated
  lower ratios of fibers within the networks in cases, reaching the statistical significance
  only in the left hemisphere for both networks. Finally, VBA and connectivity results
  were also correlated with functional outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The rabbit model used
  reproduced long-term functional impairments and their neurostructural correlates
  of abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR. The description of the pattern
  of microstructural changes underlying functional defects may help to develop biomarkers
  based in diffusion MRI and connectivity analysis.'
