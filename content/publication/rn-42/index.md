abstract: Human cortical development during the third trimester is characterised by
  macro- and microstructural changes which are reflected in alterations in diffusion
  MRI (dMRI) measures, with significant decreases in cortical mean diffusivity (MD)
  and fractional anisotropy (FA). This has been interpreted as reflecting increased
  cellular density and dendritic arborisation. However, the fall in FA stops abruptly
  at 38 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA), and then tends to plateau, while MD continues
  to fall, suggesting a more complex picture and raising the hypothesis that after
  this age development is dominated by continuing increase in neural and organelle
  density rather than alterations in the geometry of dendritic trees. To test this,
  we used neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), acquiring multi-shell,
  high angular resolution dMRI and measures of cortical volume and mean curvature
  in 99 preterm infants scanned between 25 and 47 weeks PMA. We predicted that increased
  neurite and organelle density would be reflected in increases in neurite density
  index (NDI), while a relatively unchanging geometrical structure would be associated
  with constant orientation dispersion index (ODI). As dendritic arborisation is likely
  to be one of the drivers of gyrification, we also predicted that measures of cortical
  volume and curvature would correlate with ODI and show slower growth after 38 weeks.
  We observed a decrease of MD throughout the period, while cortical FA decreased
  from 25 to 38 weeks PMA and then increased. ODI increased up to 38 weeks and then
  plateaued, while NDI rose after 38 weeks. The evolution of ODI correlated with cortical
  volume and curvature. Regional analysis of cortical microstructure revealed a heterogenous
  pattern with increases in FA and NDI after 38 weeks confined to primary motor and
  sensory regions. These results support the interpretation that cortical development
  between 25 and 38 weeks PMA shows a predominant increase in dendritic arborisation
  and neurite growth, while between 38 and 47 weeks PMA it is dominated by increasing
  cellular and organelle density.
