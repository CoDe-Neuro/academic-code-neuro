abstract: Characterization of brain changes produced by intrauterine growth restriction
  (IUGR) is among the main challenges of modern fetal medicine and pediatrics. This
  condition affects 5-10% of all pregnancies and is associated with a wide range of
  neurodevelopmental disorders. Better understanding of the brain reorganization produced
  by IUGR opens a window of opportunity to find potential imaging biomarkers in order
  to identify the infants with a high risk of having neurodevelopmental problems and
  apply therapies to improve their outcomes. Structural brain networks obtained from
  diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising tool to study brain reorganization
  and to be used as a biomarker of neurodevelopmental alterations. In the present
  study this technique is applied to a rabbit animal model of IUGR, which presents
  some advantages including a controlled environment and the possibility to obtain
  high quality MRI with long acquisition times. Using a Q-Ball diffusion model, and
  a previously published rabbit brain MRI atlas, structural brain networks of 15 IUGR
  and 14 control rabbits at 70 days of age (equivalent to pre-adolescence human age)
  were obtained. The analysis of graph theory features showed a decreased network
  infrastructure (degree and binary global efficiency) associated with IUGR condition
  and a set of generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) weighted measures associated
  with abnormal neurobehavior. Interestingly, when assessing the brain network organization
  independently of network infrastructure by means of normalized networks, IUGR showed
  increased global and local efficiencies. We hypothesize that this effect could reflect
  a compensatory response to reduced infrastructure in IUGR. These results present
  new evidence on the long-term persistence of the brain reorganization produced by
  IUGR that could underlie behavioral and developmental alterations previously described.
  The described changes in network organization have the potential to be used as biomarkers
  to monitor brain changes produced by experimental therapies in IUGR animal model.
