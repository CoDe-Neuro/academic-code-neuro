abstract: "In the mature brain, structural and functional 'fingerprints' of brain
  connectivity can be used to identify the uniqueness of an individual. However, whether
  the characteristics that make a given brain distinguishable from others already
  exist at birth remains unknown. Here, we used neuroimaging data from the developing
  Human Connectome Project (dHCP) of preterm born neonates who were scanned twice
  during the perinatal period to assess the developing brain fingerprint. We found
  that 62% of the participants could be identified based on the congruence of the
  later structural connectome to the initial connectivity matrix derived from the
  earlier timepoint. In contrast, similarity between functional connectomes of the
  same subject at different time points was low. Only 10% of the participants showed
  greater self-similarity in comparison to self-to-other-similarity for the functional
  connectome. These results suggest that structural connectivity is more stable in
  early life and can represent a potential connectome fingerprint of the individual:
  a relatively stable structural connectome appears to support a changing functional
  connectome at a time when neonates must rapidly acquire new skills to adapt to their
  new environment."
