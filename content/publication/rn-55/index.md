abstract: Cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion
  (BCCAo) in rodents has been proposed as an experimental model of white matter damage
  and vascular dementia. However, the histopathological and behavioral alterations
  reported in this model are variable and a full characterization of the dynamic alterations
  is not available. Here we implemented a longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI) design, including time-of-flight angiography, high resolution T1-weighted
  images, T2 relaxometry mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and cerebral blood flow
  measurements up to 12 weeks after BCCAo or sham-operation in Wistar rats. Changes
  in MRI were related to behavioral performance in executive function tasks and histopathological
  alterations in the same animals. MRI frequently (70%) showed various degrees of
  acute ischemic lesions, ranging from very small to large subcortical infarctions.
  Independently, delayed MRI changes were also apparent. The patterns of MRI alterations
  were related to either ischemic necrosis or gliosis. Progressive microstructural
  changes revealed by diffusion tensor imaging in white matter were confirmed by observation
  of myelinated fiber degeneration, including severe optic tract degeneration. The
  latter interfered with the visually cued learning paradigms used to test executive
  functions. Independently of brain damage, BCCAo induced progressive arteriogenesis
  in the vertebrobasilar tree, a process that was associated with blood flow recovery
  after 12 weeks. The structural alterations found in the basilar artery were compatible
  with compensatory adaptive changes driven by shear stress. In summary, BCCAo in
  rats induces specific signatures in multimodal MRI that are compatible with various
  types of histological lesion and with marked adaptive arteriogenesis.
