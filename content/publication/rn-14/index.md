abstract: Developmental delays in infanthood often persist, turning into life-long
  difficulties, and coming at great cost for the individual and community. By examining
  the developing brain and its relation to developmental outcomes we can start to
  elucidate how the emergence of brain circuits is manifested in variability of infant
  motor, cognitive and behavioural capacities. In this study, we examined if cortical
  structural covariance at birth, indexing coordinated development, is related to
  later infant behaviour. We included 193 healthy term-born infants from the Developing
  Human Connectome Project (dHCP). An individual cortical connectivity matrix derived
  from morphological and microstructural features was computed for each subject (morphometric
  similarity networks, MSNs) and was used as input for the prediction of behavioural
  scores at 18 months using Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM). Neonatal MSNs
  successfully predicted social-emotional performance. Predictive edges were distributed
  between and within known functional cortical divisions with a specific important
  role for primary and posterior cortical regions. These results reveal that multi-modal
  neonatal cortical profiles showing coordinated maturation are related to developmental
  outcomes and that network organization at birth provides an early infrastructure
  for future functional skills.
