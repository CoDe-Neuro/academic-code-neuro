abstract: 'The Developing Human Connectome Project has created a large open science
  resource which provides researchers with data for investigating typical and atypical
  brain development across the perinatal period. It has collected 1228 multimodal
  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain datasets from 1173 fetal and/or neonatal
  participants, together with collateral demographic, clinical, family, neurocognitive
  and genomic data from 1173 participants, together with collateral demographic, clinical,
  family, neurocognitive and genomic data. All subjects were studied in utero and/or
  soon after birth on a single MRI scanner using specially developed scanning sequences
  which included novel motion-tolerant imaging methods. Imaging data are complemented
  by rich demographic, clinical, neurodevelopmental, and genomic information. The
  project is now releasing a large set of neonatal data; fetal data will be described
  and released separately. This release includes scans from 783 infants of whom: 583
  were healthy infants born at term; as well as preterm infants; and infants at high
  risk of atypical neurocognitive development. Many infants were imaged more than
  once to provide longitudinal data, and the total number of datasets being released
  is 887. We now describe the dHCP image acquisition and processing protocols, summarize
  the available imaging and collateral data, and provide information on how the data
  can be accessed.'
