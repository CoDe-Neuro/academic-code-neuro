abstract: Very preterm birth (VPT; </=32 weeks' gestation) is associated with altered
  brain development and cognitive and behavioral difficulties across the lifespan.
  However, heterogeneity in outcomes among individuals born VPT makes it challenging
  to identify those most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental sequelae. Here, we aimed
  to stratify VPT children into distinct behavioral subgroups and explore between-subgroup
  differences in neonatal brain structure and function. 198 VPT children (98 females)
  previously enrolled in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging Study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42)
  underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging at term-equivalent age and neuropsychological
  assessments at 4-7 years. Using an integrative clustering approach, we combined
  neonatal socio-demographic, clinical factors and childhood socio-emotional and executive
  function outcomes, to identify distinct subgroups of children based on their similarity
  profiles in a multidimensional space. We characterized resultant subgroups using
  domain-specific outcomes (temperament, psychopathology, IQ and cognitively stimulating
  home environment) and explored between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain volumes
  (voxel-wise Tensor-Based-Morphometry), functional connectivity (voxel-wise degree
  centrality) and structural connectivity (Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics). Results
  showed two- and three-cluster data-driven solutions. The two-cluster solution comprised
  a 'resilient' subgroup (lower psychopathology and higher IQ, executive function
  and socio-emotional scores) and an 'at-risk' subgroup (poorer behavioral and cognitive
  outcomes). No neuroimaging differences between the resilient and at-risk subgroups
  were found. The three-cluster solution showed an additional third 'intermediate'
  subgroup, displaying behavioral and cognitive outcomes intermediate between the
  resilient and at-risk subgroups. The resilient subgroup had the most cognitively
  stimulating home environment and the at-risk subgroup showed the highest neonatal
  clinical risk, while the intermediate subgroup showed the lowest clinical, but the
  highest socio-demographic risk. Compared to the intermediate subgroup, the resilient
  subgroup displayed larger neonatal insular and orbitofrontal volumes and stronger
  orbitofrontal functional connectivity, while the at-risk group showed widespread
  white matter microstructural alterations. These findings suggest that risk stratification
  following VPT birth is feasible and could be used translationally to guide personalized
  interventions aimed at promoting children's resilience.
