abstract: Impaired brain development has been observed in newborns with congenital
  heart disease (CHD). We performed graph theoretical analyses and network-based statistics
  (NBS) to assess global brain network topology and identify subnetworks of altered
  connectivity in infants with CHD prior to cardiac surgery. Fifty-eight infants with
  critical/serious CHD prior to surgery and 116 matched healthy controls as part of
  the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) underwent MRI on a 3T system and
  high angular resolution diffusion MRI (HARDI) was obtained. Multi-tissue constrained
  spherical deconvolution, anatomically constrained probabilistic tractography (ACT)
  and spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2) was used to
  construct weighted structural networks. Network topology was assessed and NBS was
  used to identify structural connectivity differences between CHD and control groups.
  Structural networks were partitioned into core and peripheral nodes, and edges classed
  as core, peripheral, or feeder. NBS identified one subnetwork with reduced structural
  connectivity in CHD infants involving basal ganglia, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum,
  vermis, and temporal and parieto-occipital lobe, primarily affecting core nodes
  and edges. However, we did not find significantly different global network characteristics
  in CHD neonates. This locally affected sub-network with reduced connectivity could
  explain, at least in part, the neurodevelopmental impairments associated with CHD.
