abstract: Deep learning based medical image segmentation has shown great potential
  in becoming a key part of the clinical analysis pipeline. However, many of these
  models rely on the assumption that the train and test data come from the same distribution.
  This means that such methods cannot guarantee high quality predictions when the
  source and target domains are dissimilar due to different acquisition protocols,
  or biases in patient cohorts. Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques
  have shown great potential in alleviating this problem by minimizing the shift between
  the source and target distributions, without requiring the use of labeled data in
  the target domain. In this work, we aim to predict tissue segmentation maps on T
  (2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of an unseen preterm-born neonatal
  population, which has both different acquisition parameters and population bias
  when compared to our training data. We achieve this by investigating two unsupervised
  domain adaptation techniques with the objective of finding the best solution for
  our problem. We compare the two methods with a baseline fully-supervised segmentation
  network and report our results in terms of Dice scores obtained on our source test
  dataset. Moreover, we analyse tissue volumes and cortical thickness measures of
  the harmonized data on a subset of the population matched for gestational age at
  birth and postmenstrual age at scan. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of
  the harmonized cortical gray matter maps with an analysis comparing term and preterm-born
  neonates and a proof-of-principle investigation of the association between cortical
  thickness and a language outcome measure.
