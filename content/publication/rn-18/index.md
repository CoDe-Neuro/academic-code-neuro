abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Very preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of
  childhood psychopathology and cognitive deficits. However, the extent to which these
  developmental problems associated with preterm birth are amenable to environmental
  factors or determined by neurobiology at birth remains unclear. METHODS: We derived
  neonatal brain structural covariance networks using non-negative matrix factorization
  in 384 very preterm infants (median gestational age [range], 30.29 [23.57-32.86]
  weeks) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age (median postmenstrual
  age, 42.57 [37.86-44.86] weeks). Principal component analysis was performed on 32
  behavioral and cognitive measures assessed at preschool age (n = 206; median age,
  4.65 [4.19-7.17] years) to identify components of childhood psychopathology and
  cognition. The Cognitively Stimulating Parenting Scale assessed the level of cognitively
  stimulating experiences available to the child at home. RESULTS: Cognitively stimulating
  parenting was associated with reduced expression of a component reflecting developmental
  psychopathology and executive dysfunction consistent with the preterm phenotype
  (inattention-hyperactivity, autism spectrum behaviors, and lower executive function
  scores). In contrast, a component reflecting better general cognitive abilities
  was associated with larger neonatal gray matter volume in regions centered on key
  nodes of the salience network, but not with cognitively stimulating parenting. CONCLUSIONS:
  Our results suggest that while neonatal brain structure likely influences cognitive
  abilities in very preterm children, the severity of behavioral symptoms that are
  typically observed in these children is sensitive to a cognitively stimulating home
  environment. Very preterm children may derive meaningful mental health benefits
  from access to cognitively stimulating experiences during childhood.'
