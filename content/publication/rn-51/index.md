abstract: The feasibility to use functional MRI (fMRI) during natural sleep to assess
  low-frequency basal brain activity fluctuations in human neonates has been demonstrated,
  although its potential to characterise pathologies of prenatal origin has not yet
  been exploited. In the present study, we used intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
  as a model of altered neurodevelopment due to prenatal condition to show the suitability
  of brain networks to characterise functional brain organisation at neonatal age.
  Particularly, we analysed resting-state fMRI signal of 20 neonates with IUGR and
  13 controls, obtaining whole-brain functional networks based on correlations of
  blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in 90 grey matter regions of an anatomical
  atlas (AAL). Characterisation of the networks obtained with graph theoretical features
  showed increased network infrastructure and raw efficiencies but reduced efficiency
  after normalisation, demonstrating hyper-connected but sub-optimally organised IUGR
  functional brain networks. Significant association of network features with neurobehavioral
  scores was also found. Further assessment of spatiotemporal dynamics displayed alterations
  into features associated to frontal, cingulate and lingual cortices. These findings
  show the capacity of functional brain networks to characterise brain reorganisation
  from an early age, and their potential to develop biomarkers of altered neurodevelopment.
