abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with adverse
  neurologic consequences in childhood. However, the relationship between in utero
  exposure to air pollution and neonatal brain development is unclear. METHODS: We
  modelled maternal exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and particulate matter (PM(2.5)
  and PM(10)) at postcode level between date of conception to date of birth and studied
  the effect of prenatal air pollution exposure on neonatal brain morphology in 469
  (207 male) healthy neonates, with gestational age of >/=36 weeks. Infants underwent
  MR neuroimaging at 3 Tesla at 41.29 (36.71-45.14) weeks post-menstrual age (PMA)
  as part of the developing human connectome project (dHCP). Single pollutant linear
  regression and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were performed to assess the
  relationship between air pollution and brain morphology, adjusting for confounders
  and correcting for false discovery rate. RESULTS: Higher exposure to PM(10) and
  lower exposure to NO(2) was strongly canonically correlated to a larger relative
  ventricular volume, and moderately associated with larger relative size of the cerebellum.
  Modest associations were detected with higher exposure to PM(10) and lower exposure
  to NO(2) and smaller relative cortical grey matter and amygdala and hippocampus,
  and larger relaive brainstem and extracerebral CSF volume. No associations were
  found with white matter or deep grey nuclei volume. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show
  that prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with altered brain morphometry
  in the neonatal period, albeit with opposing results for NO(2) and PM(10). This
  finding provides further evidence that reducing levels of maternal exposure to particulate
  matter during pregnancy should be a public health priority and highlights the importance
  of understanding the impacts of air pollution on this critical development window.'
