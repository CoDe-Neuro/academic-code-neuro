abstract: "Adults born very preterm (i.e. at <33 weeks' gestation) are more susceptible
  to long-lasting structural and functional brain alterations and cognitive and socio-emotional
  difficulties, compared with full-term controls. However, behavioural heterogeneity
  within very preterm and full-term individuals makes it challenging to find biomarkers
  of specific outcomes. To address these questions, we parsed brain-behaviour heterogeneity
  in participants subdivided according to their clinical birth status (very preterm
  versus full term) and/or data-driven behavioural phenotype (regardless of birth
  status). Participants were followed-up in adulthood (median age 30 years) as part
  of a wider longitudinal case-control cohort study. The Network Based Statistic approach
  was used to identify topological components of resting state functional connectivity
  differentiating between (i) 116 very preterm and 83 full-term adults (43% and 57%
  female, respectively) and (ii) data-driven behavioural subgroups identified using
  consensus clustering (n = 156, 46% female). Age, sex, socio-economic status and
  in-scanner head motion were used as confounders in all analyses. Post hoc two-way
  group interactions between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven subgrouping
  classification labels explored whether functional connectivity differences between
  very preterm and full-term adults varied according to distinct behavioural outcomes.
  Very preterm compared with full-term adults had poorer scores in selective measures
  of cognitive and socio-emotional processing and displayed complex patterns of hyper-
  and hypo-connectivity in sub-sections of the default mode, visual and ventral attention
  networks. Stratifying the study participants in terms of their behavioural profiles
  (irrespective of birth status) identified two data-driven subgroups: an 'At-Risk'
  subgroup, characterized by increased cognitive, mental health and socio-emotional
  difficulties, displaying hypo-connectivity anchored in frontal opercular and insular
  regions, relative to a 'Resilient' subgroup with more favourable outcomes. No significant
  interaction was noted between clinical birth status and behavioural data-driven
  subgrouping classification labels in terms of functional connectivity. Functional
  connectivity differentiating between very preterm and full-term adults was dissimilar
  to functional connectivity differentiating between the data-driven behavioural subgroups.
  We speculate that functional connectivity alterations observed in very preterm relative
  to full-term adults may confer both risk and resilience to developing behavioural
  sequelae associated with very preterm birth, while the localized functional connectivity
  alterations seen in the 'At-Risk' subgroup relative to the 'Resilient' subgroup
  may underlie less favourable behavioural outcomes in adulthood, irrespective of
  birth status."
