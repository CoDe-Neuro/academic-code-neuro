abstract: "IMPORTANCE: What is inherited or acquired in neurodevelopmental conditions
  such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not a fixed outcome, but instead is a
  vulnerability to a spectrum of traits, especially social difficulties. Identifying
  the biological mechanisms associated with vulnerability requires looking as early
  in life as possible, before the brain is shaped by postnatal mechanisms and/or the
  experiences of living with these traits. Animal studies suggest that susceptibility
  to neurodevelopmental disorders arises when genetic and/or environmental risks for
  these conditions alter patterns of synchronous brain activity in the perinatal period,
  but this has never been examined in human neonates. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether
  alternation of functional maturation of social brain circuits is associated with
  a family history of ASD in newborns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this
  cohort study of 36 neonates with and without a family history of ASD, neonates underwent
  magnetic resonance imaging at St Thomas Hospital in London, England, using a dedicated
  neonatal brain imaging system between June 23, 2015, and August 1, 2018. Neonates
  with a first-degree relative with ASD (R+) and therefore vulnerable to autistic
  traits and neonates without a family history (R-) were recruited for the study.
  Synchronous neural activity in brain regions linked to social function was compared.
  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Regions responsible for social function were selected
  with reference to a published meta-analysis and the level of synchronous activity
  within each region was used as a measure of local functional connectivity in a regional
  homogeneity analysis. Group differences, controlling for sex, age at birth, age
  at scan, and group x age interactions, were examined. RESULTS: The final data set
  consisted of 18 R+ infants (13 male; median [range] postmenstrual age at scan, 42.93
  [40.00-44.86] weeks) and 18 R- infants (13 male; median [range] postmenstrual age
  at scan, 42.50 [39.29-44.58] weeks). Neonates who were R+ had significantly higher
  levels of synchronous activity in the right posterior fusiform (t = 2.48; P = .04)
  and left parietal cortices (t = 3.96; P = .04). In addition, there was a significant
  group x age interaction within the anterior segment of the left insula (t = 3.03;
  P = .04) and cingulate cortices (right anterior: t = 3.00; P = .03; left anterior:
  t = 2.81; P = .03; right posterior: t = 2.77; P = .03; left posterior: t = 2.55;
  P = .03). In R+ infants, levels of synchronous activity decreased over 39 to 45
  weeks' postmenstrual age, whereas synchronous activity levels increased in R- infants
  over the same period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Synchronous activity is required
  during maturation of functionally connected networks. This study found that in newborn
  humans, having a first-degree relative with ASD was associated with higher levels
  of local functional connectivity and dysmaturation of interconnected regions responsible
  for processing higher-order social information."
