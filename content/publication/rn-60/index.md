abstract: 'Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting ~1% of the population.
  Recently, machine learning models have been trained to classify participants with
  autism using their neuroimaging features, though the performance of these models
  varies in the literature. Differences in experimental setup hamper the direct comparison
  of different machine-learning approaches. In this paper, five of the most widely
  used and best-performing machine learning models in the field were trained to classify
  participants with autism and typically developing (TD) participants, using functional
  connectivity matrices, structural volumetric measures, and phenotypic information
  from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset. Their performance was
  compared under the same evaluation standard. The models implemented included: graph
  convolutional networks (GCN), edge-variational graph convolutional networks (EV-GCN),
  fully connected networks (FCN), autoencoder followed by a fully connected network
  (AE-FCN) and support vector machine (SVM). Our results show that all models performed
  similarly, achieving a classification accuracy around 70%. Our results suggest that
  different inclusion criteria, data modalities, and evaluation pipelines rather than
  different machine learning models may explain variations in accuracy in the published
  literature. The highest accuracy in our framework was obtained when using ensemble
  models (p < 0.001), leading to an accuracy of 72.2% and AUC = 0.77 using GCN classifiers.
  However, an SVM classifier performed with an accuracy of 70.1% and AUC = 0.77, just
  marginally below GCN, and significant differences were not found when comparing
  different algorithms under the same testing conditions (p > 0.05). Furthermore,
  we also investigated the stability of features identified by the different machine
  learning models using the SmoothGrad interpretation method. The FCN model demonstrated
  the highest stability in selecting relevant features contributing to model decision
  making. The code is available at https://github.com/YilanDong19/Machine-learning-with-ABIDE.'
