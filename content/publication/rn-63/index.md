abstract: Increasing lines of evidence suggest white matter (WM) structural changes
  associated with autism can be detected in the first year of life. Despite the condition
  having high heritability, the relationship between autism common genetic variants
  and WM changes during this period remains unclear. By employing advanced regional
  and whole-brain fixel-based analysis, the current study investigated the association
  between autism polygenic scores (PS) and WM microscopic fibre density and macrostructural
  morphology in 221 term-born infants of European ancestry from the developing Human
  Connectome Project. The results suggest greater tract mean fibre-bundle cross-section
  of the left superior corona radiata is associated with higher autism PS. Subsequent
  exploratory enrichment analysis revealed that the autism risk single nucleotide
  polymorphisms most associated with the imaging phenotype may have roles in neuronal
  cellular components. Together, these findings suggest a possible link between autism
  common variants and early WM development.
