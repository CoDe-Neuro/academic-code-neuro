abstract: Premature birth occurs during a period of rapid brain growth. In this context,
  interpreting clinical neuroimaging can be complicated by the typical changes in
  brain contrast, size and gyrification occurring in the background to any pathology.
  To model and describe this evolving background in brain shape and contrast, we used
  a Bayesian regression technique, Gaussian process regression, adapted to multiple
  correlated outputs. Using MRI, we simultaneously estimated brain tissue intensity
  on T1- and T2-weighted scans as well as local tissue shape in a large cohort of
  408 neonates scanned cross-sectionally across the perinatal period. The resulting
  model provided a continuous estimate of brain shape and intensity, appropriate to
  age at scan, degree of prematurity and sex. Next, we investigated the clinical utility
  of this model to detect focal white matter injury. In individual neonates, we calculated
  deviations of a neonate's observed MRI from that predicted by the model to detect
  punctate white matter lesions with very good accuracy (area under the curve > 0.95).
  To investigate longitudinal consistency of the model, we calculated model deviations
  in 46 neonates who were scanned on a second occasion. These infants' voxelwise deviations
  from the model could be used to identify them from the other 408 images in 83% (T2-weighted)
  and 76% (T1-weighted) of cases, indicating an anatomical fingerprint. Our approach
  provides accurate estimates of non-linear changes in brain tissue intensity and
  shape with clear potential for radiological use.
