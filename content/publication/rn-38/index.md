abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) studies using the tensor model have identified abnormal
  white matter development associated with perinatal risk factors in preterm infants
  studied at term equivalent age (TEA). However, this model is an oversimplification
  of the underlying neuroanatomy. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) is a novel quantitative
  framework, which identifies microstructural and macrostructural changes in individual
  fibre populations within voxels containing crossing fibres. The aim of this study
  was to apply FBA to investigate the relationship between fixel-based measures of
  apparent fibre density (FD), fibre bundle cross-section (FC), and fibre density
  and cross-section (FDC) and perinatal risk factors in preterm infants at TEA. We
  studied 50 infants (28 male) born at 24.0-32.9 (median 30.4) weeks gestational age
  (GA) and imaged at 38.6-47.1 (median 42.1) weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). dMRI data
  were acquired in non-collinear directions with b-value 2500â€¯s/mm(2) on a 3 Tesla
  system sited on the neonatal intensive care unit. FBA was performed to assess the
  relationship between FD, FC, FDC and PMA at scan, GA at birth, days on mechanical
  ventilation, days on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), birthweight z-score, and
  sex. FBA reveals fibre population-specific alterations in FD, FC and FDC associated
  with clinical risk factors. FD was positively correlated with GA at birth and was
  negatively correlated with number of days requiring ventilation. FC was positively
  correlated with GA at birth, birthweight z-scores and was higher in males. FC was
  negatively correlated with number of days on ventilation and days on TPN. FDC was
  positively correlated with GA at birth and birthweight z-scores, negatively correlated
  with days on ventilation and days on TPN and higher in males. We demonstrate that
  these relationships are fibre-specific even within regions of crossing fibres. These
  results show that aberrant white matter development involves both microstructural
  changes and macrostructural alterations.
