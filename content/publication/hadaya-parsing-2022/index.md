abstract: Abstract Very preterm birth (VPT; ≤ 32 weeks’ gestation) is associated with
  altered brain development and cognitive and behavioral difficulties across the lifespan.
  However, heterogeneity in outcomes among individuals born VPT makes it challenging
  to identify those most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental sequelae. Here, we aimed
  to stratify VPT children into distinct behavioral subgroups and explore between-subgroup
  differences in neonatal brain structure and function. 198 VPT children (98 females)
  previously enrolled in the Evaluation of Preterm Imaging study (EudraCT 2009-011602-42)
  underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging at term-equivalent age and neuropsychological
  assessments at 4-7 years. Using an integrative clustering approach, we combined
  neonatal socio-demographic, clinical factors and childhood socio-emotional and executive
  function outcomes, to identify distinct subgroups of children based on their similarity
  profiles in a multidimensional space. We characterized resultant subgroups using
  domain-specific outcomes (temperament, psychopathology, IQ and cognitively stimulating
  home environment) and explored between-subgroup differences in neonatal brain volumes
  (voxel-wise Tensor-Based-Morphometry), functional connectivity (voxel-wise degree
  centrality) and structural connectivity (Tract-Based-Spatial-Statistics). Results
  showed two-and three-cluster data-driven solutions. The two-cluster solution comprised
  a ‘resilient’ subgroup (lower psychopathology and higher IQ, executive function
  and socio-emotional outcomes) and an ‘at-risk’ subgroup (poorer behavioral and cognitive
  outcomes). The three-cluster solution showed an additional third ‘intermediate’
  subgroup displaying behavioral and cognitive outcomes intermediate between the resilient
  and at-risk subgroups. The resilient subgroup had the most cognitively stimulating
  home environment and the at-risk subgroup showed the highest neonatal clinical risk,
  while the intermediate subgroup showed the lowest clinical but the highest socio-demographic
  risk. Compared to the intermediate subgroup, the resilient subgroup displayed larger
  neonatal insular and orbitofrontal volumes and stronger orbitofrontal functional
  connectivity, while the at-risk group showed widespread white matter microstructural
  alterations. These findings suggest that risk stratification following VPT birth
  is feasible and could be used translationally to guide personalized interventions
  aimed at promoting children’s resilience.
