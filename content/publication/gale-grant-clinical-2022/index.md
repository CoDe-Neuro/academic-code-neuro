abstract: Abstract  Importance Autism traits typically emerge between the ages of
  1 and 2. It is not known if experiences which increase the likelihood of childhood
  autism are related to early trait emergence, or if other exposures are more important.
  Identifying factors linked to toddler autism traits may improve our understanding
  of the mechanisms underlying atypical neurodevelopment.   Objective To characterise
  the association between 18-month autism traits and clinical, socio-demographic,
  and parental factors.   Design  This is a cohort study of toddlers (n=536). Clinical,
  socio-demographic, and parental information was collected at birth (gestational
  age at birth, sex, maternal body mass index, age, parental education level, parental
  first language, parental history of neurodevelopmental disorders) and at 18 months
  (parent cohabiting status, two measures of social deprivation, three measures of
  maternal parenting style, and a measure of maternal postnatal depression). General
  neurodevelopment was assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development,
  3 rd Edition (BSID-III), and autism traits were assessed using the Quantitative
  Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT). Multivariable models were used to identify
  associations between variables and Q-CHAT. A model including BSID-III was used to
  identify factors associated with Q-CHAT independent of general neurodevelopment.
  Models were also evaluated addressing variable collinearity with principal component
  analysis (PCA).    Setting Single centre (London, UK).   Participants Sub-sample
  from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP).   Results A multivariable model
  explained 20% of Q-CHAT variance, with four individually significant variables (two
  measures of parenting style and two measures of socio-economic deprivation). After
  adding general neurodevelopment into the model 37% of Q-CHAT variance was explained,
  with three individually significant variables (two measures of parenting style and
  one measure of language development). After addressing variable collinearity with
  PCA, experience of early life adversity was positively correlated with Q-CHAT score
  via a single principal component, independently of general neurodevelopment. Neither
  sex nor family history of autism were associated with Q-CHAT score.   Conclusions
  and Relevance Our findings question whether potential autism diagnoses are being
  missed in more socially deprived groups, or if there are unidentified factors influencing
  the likelihood of transitioning from early traits at age 18 months to a clinical
  autism diagnosis in childhood.   Key Points  Question What factors influence autism
  trait emergence in toddlers?   Findings In this cohort study of 536 toddlers we
  observed a positive association between exposure to early-life psycho-social adversity
  and autism traits at age 18 months. Associations were independent of general neurodevelopment.
  Factors known to increase the likelihood of a childhood autism diagnosis, such as
  sex, family history of autism or gestational age at birth, were not associated with
  autism traits at 18 months.   Meaning Psycho-social adversity has a significant
  influence on early-life autism trait emergence.
