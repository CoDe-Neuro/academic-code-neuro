abstract: Rabbit brain has been used in several works for the analysis of neurodevelopment.
  However, there are not specific digital rabbit brain atlases that allow an automatic
  identification of brain regions, which is a crucial step for various neuroimage
  analyses, and, instead, manual delineation of areas of interest must be performed
  in order to evaluate a specific structure. For this reason, we propose an atlas
  of the rabbit brain based on magnetic resonance imaging, including both structural
  and diffusion weighted, that can be used for the automatic parcellation of the rabbit
  brain. Ten individual atlases, as well as an average template and probabilistic
  maps of the anatomical regions were built. In addition, an example of automatic
  segmentation based on this atlas is described.
