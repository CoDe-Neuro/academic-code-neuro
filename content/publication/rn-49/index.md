abstract: 'Adverse conditions during fetal life have been associated to both structural
  and functional changes in neurodevelopment from the neonatal period to adolescence.
  In this study, connectomics was used to assess the evolution of brain networks from
  infancy to early adolescence. Brain network reorganization over time in subjects
  who had suffered adverse perinatal conditions is characterized and related to neurodevelopment
  and cognition. Three cohorts of prematurely born infants and children (between 28
  and 35 weeks of gestational age), including individuals with a birth weight appropriated
  for gestational age and with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), were evaluated
  at 1, 6, and 10 years of age, respectively. A common developmental trajectory of
  brain networks was identified in both control and IUGR groups: network efficiencies
  of the fractional anisotropy (FA)-weighted and normalized connectomes increase with
  age, which can be related to maturation and myelination of fiber connections while
  the number of connections decreases, which can be associated to an axonal pruning
  process and reorganization. Comparing subjects with or without IUGR, a similar pattern
  of network differences between groups was observed in the three developmental stages,
  mainly characterized by IUGR group having reduced brain network efficiencies in
  binary and FA-weighted connectomes and increased efficiencies in the connectome
  normalized by its total connection strength (FA). Associations between brain networks
  and neurobehavioral impairments were also evaluated showing a relationship between
  different network metrics and specific social cognition-related scores, as well
  as a higher risk of inattention/hyperactivity and/or executive functional disorders
  in IUGR children.'
