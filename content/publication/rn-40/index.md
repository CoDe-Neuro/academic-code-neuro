abstract: Background Abnormal macrostructural development of the cerebral cortex has
  been associated with hypoxia in infants with congenital heart disease ( CHD ). Animal
  studies have suggested that hypoxia results in cortical dysmaturation at the cellular
  level. New magnetic resonance imaging techniques offer the potential to investigate
  the relationship between cerebral oxygen delivery and cortical microstructural development
  in newborn infants with CHD . Methods and Results We measured cortical macrostructural
  and microstructural properties in 48 newborn infants with serious or critical CHD
  and 48 age-matched healthy controls. Cortical volume and gyrification index were
  calculated from high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. Neurite density
  and orientation dispersion indices were modeled using high-angular-resolution diffusion
  magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebral oxygen delivery was estimated in infants with
  CHD using phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging and preductal pulse oximetry.
  We used gray matter-based spatial statistics to examine voxel-wise group differences
  in cortical microstructure. Microstructural development of the cortex was abnormal
  in 48 infants with CHD , with regions of increased fractional anisotropy and reduced
  orientation dispersion index compared with 48 healthy controls, correcting for gestational
  age at birth and scan (family-wise error corrected for multiple comparisons at P<0.05).
  Regions of reduced cortical orientation dispersion index in infants with CHD were
  related to impaired cerebral oxygen delivery ( R(2)=0.637; n=39). Cortical orientation
  dispersion index was associated with the gyrification index ( R(2)=0.589; P<0.001;
  n=48). Conclusions This study suggests that the primary component of cerebral cortex
  dysmaturation in CHD is impaired dendritic arborization, which may underlie abnormal
  macrostructural findings reported in this population, and that the degree of impairment
  is related to reduced cerebral oxygen delivery.
