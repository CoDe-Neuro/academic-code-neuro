abstract: Abstract The Developing Human Connectome Project is an Open Science project
  that provides the first large sample of neonatal functional MRI data with high temporal
  and spatial resolution. These data enable mapping of intrinsic functional connectivity
  between spatially distributed brain regions under normal and adverse perinatal circumstances,
  offering a framework to study the ontogeny of large-scale brain organization in
  humans. Here, we characterize in unprecedented detail the maturation and integrity
  of resting state networks (RSNs) at term-equivalent age in 337 infants (including
  65 born preterm). First, we applied group independent component analysis to define
  11 RSNs in term-born infants scanned at 43.5–44.5 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).
  Adult-like topography was observed in RSNs encompassing primary sensorimotor, visual
  and auditory cortices. Among six higher-order, association RSNs, analogues of the
  adult networks for language and ocular control were identified, but a complete default
  mode network precursor was not. Next, we regressed the subject-level datasets from
  an independent cohort of infants scanned at 37–43.5 weeks PMA against the group-level
  RSNs to test for the effects of age, sex and preterm birth. Brain mapping in term-born
  infants revealed areas of positive association with age across four of six association
  RSNs, indicating active maturation in functional connectivity from 37 to 43.5 weeks
  PMA. Female infants showed increased connectivity in inferotemporal regions of the
  visual association network. Preterm birth was associated with striking impairments
  of functional connectivity across all RSNs in a dose-dependent manner; conversely,
  connectivity of the superior parietal lobules within the lateral motor network was
  abnormally increased in preterm infants, suggesting a possible mechanism for specific
  difficulties such as developmental coordination disorder, which occur frequently
  in preterm children. Overall, we found a robust, modular, symmetrical functional
  brain organization at normal term age. A complete set of adult-equivalent primary
  RSNs is already instated, alongside emerging connectivity in immature association
  RSNs, consistent with a primary-to-higher order ontogenetic sequence of brain development.
  The early developmental disruption imposed by preterm birth is associated with extensive
  alterations in functional connectivity.
