abstract: The development of perinatal brain connectivity underpins motor, cognitive
  and behavioural abilities in later life. Diffusion MRI allows the characterisation
  of subtle inter-individual differences in structural brain connectivity. Individual
  brain connectivity maps (connectomes) are by nature high in dimensionality and complex
  to interpret. Machine learning methods are a powerful tool to uncover properties
  of the connectome which are not readily visible and can give us clues as to how
  and why individual developmental trajectories differ. In this manuscript we used
  Deep Neural Networks and Random Forests to predict demographic and neurodevelopmental
  characteristics from neonatal structural connectomes in a large sample of babies
  (n = 524) from the developing Human Connectome Project. We achieved an accurate
  prediction of post menstrual age (PMA) at scan in term-born infants (mean absolute
  error (MAE) = 0.72 weeks, r = 0.83 and p < 0.001). We also achieved good accuracy
  when predicting gestational age at birth in a cohort of term and preterm babies
  scanned at term equivalent age (MAE = 2.21 weeks, r = 0.82, p < 0.001). We subsequently
  used sensitivity analysis to obtain feature relevance from our prediction models,
  with the most important connections for prediction of PMA and GA found to predominantly
  involve frontal and temporal regions, thalami, and basal ganglia. From our models
  of PMA at scan for infants born at term, we computed a brain maturation index (predicted
  age minus actual age) of individual preterm neonates and found a significant correlation
  between this index and motor outcome at 18 months corrected age. Our results demonstrate
  the applicability of machine learning techniques in analyses of the neonatal connectome
  and suggest that a neural substrate of brain maturation with implications for future
  neurodevelopment is detectable at term equivalent age from the neonatal connectome.
