abstract: 1. Abstract Recent genome-wide association studies have identified numerous
  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with subcortical brain volumes.
  These studies have been undertaken in largely adult cohorts. To better understand
  the role of genetic variability in foetal and perinatal brain development, we investigate
  how common genetic variation affects subcortical brain development in a cohort of
  208 term-born infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We examine six
  SNPs, that have shown robust associations with subcortical brain volumes in adult
  studies and ask if these associations exist at birth. We then investigate whether
  genome-wide polygenic scores (GPSs) for adult subcortical brain volumes are predictive
  of the corresponding neonatal brain volume. Finally, we explore the relationship
  between GPSs for psychiatric disorders and subcortical brain volume at birth.  We
  find the association between SNP rs945270 and putamen volume, seen in adults, is
  present at birth (p=3.67×10 -3 , β=0.13, SE=0.04). The associations between SNP
  rs61921502 and hippocampal volume and SNP rs11111090 and brainstem volume are also
  nominally present in our neonatal cohort. We show that neonatal hippocampal, brainstem,
  putamen and thalamic volume are all significantly associated with the GPSs for their
  corresponding volume in adults. Finally, we find that GPSs for five psychiatric
  disorders and a cross-disorder score are not significantly predictive of subcortical
  brain volumes or total brain volume at birth. Our results indicate that SNPs important
  in shaping adult subcortical brain volume are also significant in foetal and perinatal
  brain development.   Key Points   We show that the association between the single
  nucleotide polymorphism, rs945270 and putamen volume, seen in adults, is present
  in neonates.   We show that neonatal hippocampal, putamen, brainstem and thalamic
  volumes are all significantly predicted by the genome-wide polygenic scores for
  corresponding adult brain volumes.   We do not find any robust association between
  genome-wide polygenic scores for psychiatric disorders and neonatal brain volume
  although we observe several nominal associations.
