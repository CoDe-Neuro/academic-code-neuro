abstract: Brain dynamic functional connectivity characterises transient connections
  between brain regions. Features of brain dynamics have been linked to emotion and
  cognition in adult individuals, and atypical patterns have been associated with
  neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism. Although reliable functional brain
  networks have been consistently identified in neonates, little is known about the
  early development of dynamic functional connectivity. In this study we characterise
  dynamic functional connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  in the first few weeks of postnatal life in term-born (n = 324) and preterm-born
  (n = 66) individuals. We show that a dynamic landscape of brain connectivity is
  already established by the time of birth in the human brain, characterised by six
  transient states of neonatal functional connectivity with changing dynamics through
  the neonatal period. The pattern of dynamic connectivity is atypical in preterm-born
  infants, and associated with atypical social, sensory, and repetitive behaviours
  measured by the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) scores at
  18 months of age.
