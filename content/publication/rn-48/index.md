abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Chronic reduction of oxygen and nutrient delivery to the
  fetus has been related to neurodevelopmental problems. Placental underperfusion
  induces a significant reduction in oxygen and nutrient delivery, whereas maternal
  undernutrition causes mainly nutrient deficiency. A comparison of the neurodevelopmental
  effects of both situations in pregnant rabbits was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  The placental underperfusion model was induced after uteroplacental vessel ligation
  at 25 days of pregnancy. The undernutrition model was induced after a reduction
  of 70% of the basal maternal intake at 22 days of pregnancy. Neurobehavioral tests
  were applied in the derived offspring at the neonatal period and over the long term.
  Structural brain differences were evaluated by brain networks obtained from diffusion
  magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Birth weight was significantly lower in both
  cases. However, stillbirth was only increased in the placental underperfusion model.
  Cases from both models presented poorer neurobehavioral performance and network
  infrastructure, being more pronounced in the placental underperfusion model. DISCUSSION:
  Prenatal insults during the last third of gestation resulted in functional and structural
  disturbances. The degree of neurodevelopmental impairment and its association with
  structural brain reorganization seemed to be related to the type of the prenatal
  insult, showing stronger effects in the placental underperfusion model.'
