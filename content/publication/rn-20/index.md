abstract: "BACKGROUND: Childhood infratentorial tumor patients frequently suffer from
  long-term cognitive deficits. As each constituent of their treatment can lead to
  neurotoxicity, cascade effects can lead to profound reorganization of the underlying
  brain network, the so-called 'connectome'. However, to date, few studies have assessed
  the relationship between brain network topology, the functional role of network
  hubs (i.e. highly connected regions), and neurocognitive outcomes in adult survivors
  of childhood infratentorial tumors. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, childhood
  infratentorial tumor survivors (n = 21: pilocytic astrocytoma (n = 8), ependymoma
  (n = 1) and medulloblastoma (n = 12)) and healthy controls (n = 21) were recruited.
  Using multishell diffusion-weighted MRI, microstructural organization and topology
  of supratentorial white matter was investigated; using a voxel-based approach, a
  fixel-based analysis, and a graph theoretical approach. In addition, neurocognitive
  subscales of the WAIS-IV intelligence test, and their relationship with nodal strength
  and network efficiency metrics were assessed. RESULTS: Similar to earlier studies,
  we observed widespread decreases in fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients compared
  to controls, based on voxel-based analyses. In addition, the fixel-based analyses
  dissociated macro- from microstructural changes, which were encountered in in infratentorial
  versus supratentorial brain areas, respectively. Finally, regional reorganization
  (i.e. differences in local efficiency) occurred mainly in hubs, which suggests a
  specific vulnerability of these areas. These hubs were not only mostly affected,
  but also most strongly correlated with the intelligence subscales. CONCLUSION: This
  study suggests that network hubs are functionally important for intellectual outcomes
  in infratentorial tumor survivors. Furthermore, these regions could be the primary
  targets of treatment toxicity. Validation of this specific hypothesis in larger
  samples is required."
