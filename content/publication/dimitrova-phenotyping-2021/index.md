abstract: Abstract The diverse cerebral consequences of preterm birth create significant
  challenges for understanding pathogenesis or predicting later outcome. Instead of
  focusing on describing effects common to the group, comparing individual infants
  against robust normative data offers a powerful alternative to study brain maturation.
  Here we used Gaussian process regression to create normative curves characterizing
  brain volumetric development in 274 term-born infants, modeling for age at scan
  and sex. We then compared 89 preterm infants scanned at term-equivalent age with
  these normative charts, relating individual deviations from typical volumetric development
  to perinatal risk factors and later neurocognitive scores. To test generalizability,
  we used a second independent dataset comprising of 253 preterm infants scanned using
  different acquisition parameters and scanner. We describe rapid, nonuniform brain
  growth during the neonatal period. In both preterm cohorts, cerebral atypicalities
  were widespread, often multiple, and varied highly between individuals. Deviations
  from normative development were associated with respiratory support, nutrition,
  birth weight, and later neurocognition, demonstrating their clinical relevance.
  Group-level understanding of the preterm brain disguises a large degree of individual
  differences. We provide a method and normative dataset that offer a more precise
  characterization of the cerebral consequences of preterm birth by profiling the
  individual neonatal brain.
