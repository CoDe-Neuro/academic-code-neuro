abstract: Preterm infants are at high risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, which
  may be due to altered development of brain connectivity. We aimed to (i) assess
  structural brain development from 25 to 45 weeks gestational age (GA) using graph
  theoretical approaches and (ii) test the hypothesis that preterm birth results in
  altered white matter network topology. Sixty-five infants underwent MRI between
  25(+3) and 45(+6) weeks GA. Structural networks were constructed using constrained
  spherical deconvolution tractography and were weighted by measures of white matter
  microstructure (fractional anisotropy, neurite density and orientation dispersion
  index). We observed regional differences in brain maturation, with connections to
  and from deep grey matter showing most rapid developmental changes during this period.
  Intra-frontal, frontal to cingulate, frontal to caudate and inter-hemispheric connections
  matured more slowly. We demonstrated a core of key connections that was not affected
  by GA at birth. However, local connectivity involving thalamus, cerebellum, superior
  frontal lobe, cingulate gyrus and short range cortico-cortical connections was related
  to the degree of prematurity and contributed to altered global topology of the structural
  brain network. The relative preservation of core connections at the expense of local
  connections may support more effective use of impaired white matter reserve following
  preterm birth.
