abstract: Preterm-born children are at increased risk of lifelong neurodevelopmental
  difficulties. Group-wise analyses of magnetic resonance imaging show many differences
  between preterm- and term-born infants but do not reliably predict neurocognitive
  prognosis for individual infants. This might be due to the unrecognized heterogeneity
  of cerebral injury within the preterm group. This study aimed to determine whether
  atypical brain microstructural development following preterm birth is significantly
  variable between infants. Using Gaussian process regression, a technique that allows
  a single-individual inference, we characterized typical variation of brain microstructure
  using maps of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity in a sample of 270 term-born
  neonates. Then, we compared 82 preterm infants to these normative values to identify
  brain regions with atypical microstructure and relate observed deviations to degree
  of prematurity and neurocognition at 18 months. Preterm infants showed strikingly
  heterogeneous deviations from typical development, with little spatial overlap between
  infants. Greater and more extensive deviations, captured by a whole brain atypicality
  index, were associated with more extreme prematurity and predicted poorer cognitive
  and language abilities at 18 months. Brain microstructural development after preterm
  birth is highly variable between individual infants. This poorly understood heterogeneity
  likely relates to both the etiology and prognosis of brain injury.
