abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The dynamic nature and complexity of the cellular events
  that take place during the last trimester of pregnancy make the developing cortex
  particularly vulnerable to perturbations. Abrupt interruption to normal gestation
  can lead to significant deviations to many of these processes, resulting in atypical
  trajectory of cortical maturation in preterm birth survivors. METHODS: We sought
  to first map typical cortical micro- and macrostructure development using invivo
  MRI in a large sample of healthy term-born infants scanned after birth (n = 259).
  Then we offer a comprehensive characterization of the cortical consequences of preterm
  birth in 76 preterm infants scanned at term-equivalent age (37-44 weeks postmenstrual
  age). We describe the group-average atypicality, the heterogeneity across individual
  preterm infants, and relate individual deviations from normative development to
  age at birth and neurodevelopment at 18 months. RESULTS: In the term-born neonatal
  brain, we observed heterogeneous and regionally specific associations between age
  at scan and measures of cortical morphology and microstructure, including rapid
  surface expansion, greater cortical thickness, lower cortical anisotropy and higher
  neurite orientation dispersion. By term-equivalent age, preterm infants had on average
  increased cortical tissue water content and reduced neurite density index in the
  posterior parts of the cortex, and greater cortical thickness anteriorly compared
  to term-born infants. While individual preterm infants were more likely to show
  extreme deviations (over 3.1 standard deviations) from normative cortical maturation
  compared to term-born infants, these extreme deviations were highly variable and
  showed very little spatial overlap between individuals. Measures of regional cortical
  development were associated with age at birth, but not with neurodevelopment at
  18 months. CONCLUSION: We showed that preterm birth alters cortical micro- and macrostructural
  maturation near the time of full-term birth. Deviations from normative development
  were highly variable between individual preterm infants.'
