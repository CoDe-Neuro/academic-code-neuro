abstract: 'PURPOSE: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) studies report altered
  white matter (WM) development in preterm infants. Neurite orientation dispersion
  and density imaging (NODDI) metrics provide more realistic estimations of neurite
  architecture in vivo compared with standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics.
  This study investigated microstructural maturation of WM in preterm neonates scanned
  between 25 and 45 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) with normal neurodevelopmental outcomes
  at 2 years using DTI and NODDI metrics. METHODS: Thirty-one neonates (n = 17 male)
  with median (range) gestational age (GA) 32(+1) weeks (24(+2)-36(+4)) underwent
  3 T brain MRI at median (range) post menstrual age (PMA) 35(+2) weeks (25(+3)-43(+1)).
  WM tracts (cingulum, fornix, corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal fasciculus
  (ILF), optic radiations) were delineated using constrained spherical deconvolution
  and probabilistic tractography in MRtrix3. DTI and NODDI metrics were extracted
  for the whole tract and cross-sections along each tract to assess regional development.
  RESULTS: PMA at scan positively correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) in the
  CST, fornix and optic radiations and neurite density index (NDI) in the cingulum,
  CST and fornix and negatively correlated with mean diffusivity (MD) in all tracts.
  A multilinear regression model demonstrated PMA at scan influenced all diffusion
  measures, GA and GAxPMA at scan influenced FA, MD and NDI and gender affected NDI.
  Cross-sectional analyses revealed asynchronous WM maturation within and between
  WM tracts.). CONCLUSION: We describe normal WM maturation in preterm neonates with
  normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. NODDI can enhance our understanding of WM maturation
  compared with standard DTI metrics alone.'
