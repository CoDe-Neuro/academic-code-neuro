abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with short- and
  long-term neurodevelopmental problems. Structural brain changes underlying these
  alterations have been described with the use of different magnetic resonance-based
  methods that include changes in whole structural brain networks. However, evaluation
  of specific brain circuits and its correlation with related functions has not been
  investigated in intrauterine growth restriction. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed
  to investigate differences in tractography-related metrics in cortico-striatal-thalamic
  and motor networks in intrauterine growth restricted children and whether these
  parameters were related with their specific function in order to explore its potential
  use as an imaging biomarker of altered neurodevelopment. METHODS: We included a
  group of 24 intrauterine growth restriction subjects and 27 control subjects that
  were scanned at 1 year old; we acquired T1-weighted and 30 directions diffusion
  magnetic resonance images. Each subject brain was segmented in 93 regions with the
  use of anatomical automatic labeling atlas, and deterministic tractography was performed.
  Brain regions included in motor and cortico-striatal-thalamic networks were defined
  based in functional and anatomic criteria. Within the streamlines that resulted
  from the whole brain tractography, those belonging to each specific circuit were
  selected and tractography-related metrics that included number of streamlines, fractional
  anisotropy, and integrity were calculated for each network. We evaluated differences
  between both groups and further explored the correlation of these parameters with
  the results of socioemotional, cognitive, and motor scales from Bayley Scale at
  2 years of age. RESULTS: Reduced fractional anisotropy (cortico-striatal-thalamic,
  0.319 +/- 0.018 vs 0.315 +/- 0.015; P = .010; motor, 0.322 +/- 0.019 vs 0.319 +/-
  0.020; P = .019) and integrity cortico-striatal-thalamic (0.407 +/- 0.040 vs 0.399
  +/- 0.034; P = .018; motor, 0.417 +/- 0.044 vs 0.409 +/- 0.046; P = .016) in both
  networks were observed in the intrauterine growth restriction group, with no differences
  in number of streamlines. More importantly, strong specific correlation was found
  between tractography-related metrics and its relative function in both networks
  in intrauterine growth restricted children. Motor network metrics were correlated
  specifically with motor scale results (fractional anisotropy: rho = 0.857; integrity:
  rho = 0.740); cortico-striatal-thalamic network metrics were correlated with cognitive
  (fractional anisotropy: rho = 0.793; integrity, rho = 0.762) and socioemotional
  scale (fractional anisotropy: rho = 0.850; integrity: rho = 0.877). CONCLUSIONS:
  These results support the existence of altered brain connectivity in intrauterine
  growth restriction demonstrated by altered connectivity in motor and cortico-striatal-thalamic
  networks, with reduced fractional anisotropy and integrity. The specific correlation
  between tractography-related metrics and neurodevelopmental outcomes in intrauterine
  growth restriction shows the potential to use this approach to develop imaging biomarkers
  to predict specific neurodevelopmental outcome in infants who are at risk because
  of intrauterine growth restriction and other prenatal diseases.'
