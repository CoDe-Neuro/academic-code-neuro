abstract: The diverse cerebral consequences of preterm birth create significant challenges
  for understanding pathogenesis or predicting later outcome. Instead of focusing
  on describing effects common to the group, comparing individual infants against
  robust normative data offers a powerful alternative to study brain maturation. Here
  we used Gaussian process regression to create normative curves characterizing brain
  volumetric development in 274 term-born infants, modeling for age at scan and sex.
  We then compared 89 preterm infants scanned at term-equivalent age with these normative
  charts, relating individual deviations from typical volumetric development to perinatal
  risk factors and later neurocognitive scores. To test generalizability, we used
  a second independent dataset comprising of 253 preterm infants scanned using different
  acquisition parameters and scanner. We describe rapid, nonuniform brain growth during
  the neonatal period. In both preterm cohorts, cerebral atypicalities were widespread,
  often multiple, and varied highly between individuals. Deviations from normative
  development were associated with respiratory support, nutrition, birth weight, and
  later neurocognition, demonstrating their clinical relevance. Group-level understanding
  of the preterm brain disguises a large degree of individual differences. We provide
  a method and normative dataset that offer a more precise characterization of the
  cerebral consequences of preterm birth by profiling the individual neonatal brain.
