 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Very preterm birth is associated with an increased risk of childhood psychopathology and cognitive deficits. However, the extent to which these developmental problems associated with preterm birth are amenable to environmental factors or determined by neurobiology at birth remains unclear. METHODS: We derived neonatal brain structural covariance networks using non-negative matrix factorization in 384 very preterm infants (median gestational age [range], 30.29 [23.57-32.86] weeks) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age (median postmenstrual age, 42.57 [37.86-44.86] weeks). Principal component analysis was performed on 32 behavioral and cognitive measures assessed at preschool age (n = 206; median age, 4.65 [4.19-7.17] years) to identify components of childhood psychopathology and cognition. The Cognitively Stimulating Parenting Scale assessed the level of cognitively stimulating experiences available to the child at home. RESULTS: Cognitively stimulating parenting was associated with reduced expression of a component reflecting developmental psychopathology and executive dysfunction consistent with the preterm phenotype (inattention-hyperactivity, autism spectrum behaviors, and lower executive function scores). In contrast, a component reflecting better general cognitive abilities was associated with larger neonatal gray matter volume in regions centered on key nodes of the salience network, but not with cognitively stimulating parenting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that while neonatal brain structure likely influences cognitive abilities in very preterm children, the severity of behavioral symptoms that are typically observed in these children is sensitive to a cognitively stimulating home environment. Very preterm children may derive meaningful mental health benefits from access to cognitively stimulating experiences during childhood.},
