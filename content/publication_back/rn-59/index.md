abstract: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to placental insufficiency affects
  5-10% of all pregnancies and it is associated with a wide range of short- and long-term
  neurodevelopmental disorders. Prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in IUGR
  is among the clinical challenges of modern fetal medicine and pediatrics. In recent
  years several studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate
  differences in brain structure in IUGR subjects, but the ability to use MRI for
  individual predictive purposes in IUGR is limited. Recent research suggests that
  MRI in vivo access to brain connectivity might have the potential to help understanding
  cognitive and neurodevelopment processes. Specifically, MRI based connectomics is
  an emerging approach to extract information from MRI data that exhaustively maps
  inter-regional connectivity within the brain to build a graph model of its neural
  circuitry known as brain network. In the present study we used diffusion MRI based
  connectomics to obtain structural brain networks of a prospective cohort of one
  year old infants (32 controls and 24 IUGR) and analyze the existence of quantifiable
  brain reorganization of white matter circuitry in IUGR group by means of global
  and regional graph theory features of brain networks. Based on global and regional
  analyses of the brain network topology we demonstrated brain reorganization in IUGR
  infants at one year of age. Specifically, IUGR infants presented decreased global
  and local weighted efficiency, and a pattern of altered regional graph theory features.
  By means of binomial logistic regression, we also demonstrated that connectivity
  measures were associated with abnormal performance in later neurodevelopmental outcome
  as measured by Bayley Scale for Infant and Toddler Development, Third edition (BSID-III)
  at two years of age. These findings show the potential of diffusion MRI based connectomics
  and graph theory based network characteristics for estimating differences in the
  architecture of neural circuitry and developing imaging biomarkers of poor neurodevelopment
  outcome in infants with prenatal diseases.
